## Must Know 

> [!NOTE]
>   - LUKS encryption **safeguards data on a stolen physical or virtual volume**, regardless of whether it resides in the cloud or on a physical device.
>   - However, it's **crucial to understand** that LUKS does `not protect against attacks originating from within a compromised system`. 
>     - If an attacker gains access to a running system, they can potentially access the decrypted volume while it is mounted and in use.

>[!IMPORTANT] 
> - Losing your **LUKS keys** or **passphrases** means **permanent data loss**.
> - The only potential solution is a **successful brute-force attack** (which is often computationally infeasible) *and* requires the header to be at least partially intact.
> - If your **LUKS header** gets `corrupted`, data recovery is **extremely difficult**, bordering on impossible, unless you have a backup header.

> [!TIP]
> - Treat your **keys and headers** like you would with **the most sensitive information**.
> - Always **backup** `headers` and **associated** `keys`.
>   -  It's crucial to understand that only keys present at the time of the header backup are valid for recovery.</br>`Keys added after the header backup`, or keys previously used and `subsequently deleted`, will be unusable.

>[!NOTE]
> - Restoring an older, valid header with its corresponding keys grants access to the current data, even if the current header is corrupted or a key is lost.
> - LUKS stores encryption keys within the header, enabling access to the underlying data regardless of when it was written.
> - Access to an older header and its associated key,can decrypt the current data, posing a security risk if such backups are compromised.

> [!CAUTION] 
> **Encrypting a volume or disk** that `already contains` data *without a backup is extremely risky*. 
> - While technically possible in some cases, **it's highly discouraged**.  There's a significant chance of `data corruption or loss` during the encryption process if something goes wrong.
